***CourseDrawer*** 
=================
This tool is no longer continued, I move to the Courseplay Editor Project and will give you the link here, when ready. 
In the mean time, until we have new one ready, you can still use this Editor but i will not give support. 

External tool to draw and edit Courseplay courses directly to the XML File 

CourseDrawer is an application that has been updated and prepared for working with the new version of CoursePlay 5.0 and 6.0 (FS17, FS19) but there is no guarantee, that everything works. All Options are editable but you should not mess around with some internal values unless you know, what you ar doing. 
Make shure you have backups of your Courses.

Courses are now saved by courseplay in individual files. In order to load the courses you still need to load courseManager.xml which you can find here:
+ Goldcrest Valley Map: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\my games\FarmingSimulator2017\CoursePlay_Courses\Map**01**\courseManager.xml
+ Sosnovska Map: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\my games\FarmingSimulator2017\CoursePlay_Courses\Map**02**\courseManager.xml

In the Install Path of the game, for example **D:\Spiele\Farming Simulator 2017\data\maps**, 
you can find the background images you can load in CourseDrawer for your map. You can load the bmp or the dds file.

**How to Get it?**

See in the Release Section of this Fork for the newest Beta version. If you need a newer version you can Clone it and Compile it yourself in Visual Studio or Commandline  but i can't give you support there
