***CourseDrawer*** 
=================

External tool to draw and edit Courseplay courses directly to the XML File 

Note: Using this tool for FS19 CP 6 Courses is not recommended as you risk of loosing some Data. 
I am currently working on a update for CP6 and will publish here as soon as it is ready.

CourseDrawer is an application that has been updated and prepared for working with the new version of CoursePlay 5.0 (FS2017, LS17)

Courses are now saved by courseplay in individual files. In order to load the courses you still need to load courseManager.xml which you can find here:
+ Goldcrest Valley Map: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\my games\FarmingSimulator2017\CoursePlay_Courses\Map**01**\courseManager.xml
+ Sosnovska Map: %USERPROFILE%\Documents\my games\FarmingSimulator2017\CoursePlay_Courses\Map**02**\courseManager.xml

In the Install Path of the game, for example **D:\Spiele\Farming Simulator 2017\data\maps**, 
you can find the background images you can load in CourseDrawer for your map. You can load the bmp or the dds file.

**How to Get it?**

See in the Release Section of this Fork for the newest Beta version. If you need a newer version you can Clone it and Compile it yourself in Visual Studio or Commandline  but i can't give you support there
